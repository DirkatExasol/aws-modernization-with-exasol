# Integrating AWS Quicksight with Exasol

In this section, we delve into the effortless integration of Exasol, the hight-performance database, with Amazon Quicksight, enabling you to harness the true potential of data visualization and analysis.
Discover how these two powerful platforms seamlessly work together, empowering you to create datasets, conduct analyses, and publish interactive dashboards with remarkable ease.

## Learning Objectives <!-- MODIFY THIS SUBHEADING -->

- Understand how to easily integrate Amazon Quicksight with Exasol
- Create datasets from available tables in Exasol and apply filters for data refinement
- Create Visualizations using the prepared datasets to represent data trends effectively
- Publish visualizations as interactive dashboards for easy data-driven decision-making and collaboration

In this session, we'll explore the process of creating two new datasets by linking QuickSight to two tables within the Exasol database. These datasets will contain specific data from the SALES table, as well as enriched SALES data with country dimension information.

Once we've successfully created these datasets, we'll move on to the next step: crafting insightful analyses based on the data. These analyses will be presented visually and eventually published to a dashboard.

Throughout the workshop, we'll provide step-by-step guidance to ensure you have a smooth and enriching experience. Let's get started on this journey of exploring and analyzing data with QuickSight and Exasol!
