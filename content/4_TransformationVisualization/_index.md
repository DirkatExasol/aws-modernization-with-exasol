# Integrating AWS QuickSight with Exasol

In this section, we dive into the effortless integration of Exasol, the high-performance database, with Amazon QuickSight, enabling you to harness the true potential of data visualization and analysis.
Discover how these two powerful platforms seamlessly work together, empowering you to create a dataset, conduct analyses, and publish interactive dashboards with remarkable ease.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to easily integrate Amazon QuickSight with Exasol
- Create a dataset and at a later stage, modify the existing dataset
- Apply filters for data refinement
- Create Visualizations to represent data trends effectively
- Publish visualizations as interactive dashboards for easy data-driven decision-making and collaboration

In this session, we'll explore the process of creating a new datasets by linking QuickSight to a view within the Exasol database. The datasets will contain specific data from the <i>Retail</i> schema we have used before.

Once we've successfully created the datasets, we'll move on to the next step: crafting insightful analyses based on the data. These analyses will be presented visually and eventually published to a dashboard.

Throughout the workshop, we'll provide step-by-step guidance to ensure you have a smooth and enriching experience. Let's get started on this journey of exploring and analyzing data with QuickSight and Exasol!
