## Welcome to the Data Warehouse Modernization Workshop with b.telligent & Exasol

In this workshop, we are going to introduce Exasol, an in-memory analytics database that can serve as high-performance BI accelerator on top of an existing data lake or legacy system. Alternatively, Exasol can be implemented as a stand-alone data warehouse. Exasol speeds up time critical analytics use cases and enables companies to implement self-service analytics to provide true data democratization within organizations. As a relational analytical database, it integrates nicely into the AWS ecosystem, offering native connectors for solutions like Amazon S3, Amazon QuickSight, AWS Glue, Amazon Sagemaker and many more, thus enabling your organization to run analytics at the speed of now.
