## Welcome to the Data Warehouse Modernization Workshop with b.telligent & Exasol

In this workshop, you will get to know Exasol, an in-memory analytics database that can either act as an acceleration layer on top of a data lake or an existing warehouse. Exasol can even serve as a stand-alone data warehouse.  Exasol speeds up time critical analytics use cases and enables companies to implement self-service analytics to provide true data democratization within organizations. As a relational database management system, it integrates nicely into the AWS ecosystem, offering native connectors for solutions like Amazon S3, Amazon QuickSight, AWS Glue, Amazon Sagemaker and many more and thus it enables you to run analytics on a new level.

We will leverage these complementary analytics solutions AWS provides for these tasks. The result will be a fully-fledged analytics stack with which you can run self-service analytics and even execute advanced analytics like AI/ML.
